= Security features in {Project}

When deploying {Project}, consider implementing security features that enhance the overall security of your system.
{Project} supports multiple security mechanisms, including FIPS mode, `fapolicyd`, and SELinux, to provide additional layers of protection.

Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) Mode::
{Project} supports running on FIPS-enabled RHEL hosts to comply with security standards for cryptographic modules. 
However, {Project} itself does not currently support running in FIPS mode.
+
FIPS mode enforces the use of validated cryptographic algorithms and modules.
Enabling FIPS mode ensures that all cryptographic operations within the system adhere to strict security standards.

File Access Policy Daemon (`fapolicyd`)::
By enabling `fapolicyd` on your {Project} Server, you can monitor and control file and directory access, providing an additional security layer.
+
This feature helps prevent unauthorized code execution and enhances system integrity. You can enable or disable `fapolicyd` on both {Project} and {ProjectServer} at any time, depending on your security requirements.
+
For additional information about `fapolicyd`, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html/security_hardening/assembly_blocking-and-allowing-applications-using-fapolicyd_security-hardening[Blocking and allowing applications by using fapolicyd] in _Security hardening_.

Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux)::
{Project} supports SELinux, a mandatory access control system that restricts system access and reduces the risk of security vulnerabilities.
SELinux enforces policies that define which processes can access specific system resources, providing protection against unauthorized access and exploitation.
+
Running {Project} with SELinux in enforcing mode is recommended to maintain a high-security environment.
It ensures that access control policies are strictly enforced, minimizing the risk of privilege escalation or unauthorized actions.

Additional Security Recommendations::
Regularly updating security policies and configurations, as well as monitoring system logs and security policies, can help detect and respond to potential threats effectively.
