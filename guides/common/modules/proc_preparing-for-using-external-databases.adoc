= Preparing {Project} for using external databases

By default, the {Project} installation process includes installing a PostgreSQL database on the same host as {ProjectServer}.
However, in certain {Project} deployments, using external databases instead of the default local databases can help with the server load or have other benefits.

.Prerequisite
* You have considered whether using an external database is beneficial for your use case. 
For more information, see {AdministeringDocURL}postgresql-as-an-external-database-considerations_admin[PostgreSQL as an external database considerations] in _{AdministeringDocTitle}_.

.Procedure
. Set up a system to host the external database. 
For instructions, see {AdministeringDocURL}preparing-a-host-for-external-databases_admin[Preparing a host for external databases] in _{AdministeringDocTitle}_.

. Install PostgreSQL on the external database host you prepared. 
For instructions, see {AdministeringDocURL}installing-postgresql_admin[Installing PostgreSQL] in _{AdministeringDocTitle}_.
